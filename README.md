### Implement data sorting by Insertion sort. Sort the data in ascending order.

Determine a running time dependence on the input size when data is randomly distributed. Use 3 small input sizes (20-150) and 3 large input sizes (>10 000); with the same data size run at least 10 tests.

Present the test results in a table and with graphs.

Perform analysis of test results, compare results with theoretical estimates.

Present conclusions.
