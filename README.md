### For the assigned problem you need:

to create a program that implements a given algorithm; 
to run several tests with different data sizes; 
to upload the report to Moodle. 
The report must contain: 

a title page (0.2 point), 
an assigned problem (0.3 point), 
a short description of an algorithm (0.5 point), 
a testing environment decsription (0.5 point), 
result table(s) with test data (1 point), 
graph(s) (1 point)
analysis of testing results (3 points)
conclusions (2 point), 
a program code (1 point),
screenshots of results (0.5 point) 
The homework report should be saved as one file in *.pdf format and uploaded to Moodle by the deadline.

### Implement data sorting by Insertion sort. Sort the data in ascending order.

Determine a running time dependence on the input size when data is randomly distributed. Use 3 small input sizes (20-150) and 3 large input sizes (>10 000); with the same data size run at least 10 tests.

Present the test results in a table and with graphs.

Perform analysis of test results, compare results with theoretical estimates.

Present conclusions.
